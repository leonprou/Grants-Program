- **Level:** 1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The project introduces an address book to the Polymesh portal, allowing users to assign name tags to DID and its the associated keys. This addition aims to enhance the overall user experience of the portal, making it easy to perform and oversee transactions with the help of the address book.

### Project Details

#### Address Book Page

When accessing the address book page, user is presented with a table displaying address book entities with fields such as name tag, DID, and key (primary). The available actions include adding, removing, or editing items within the address book. Users can conveniently search the address book, and there are options for exporting and importing items to and from CSV

The address book entities are stored in local storage, making it accessible within the user's browser environment only.

#### Address Entity popup

The address entity popup appears whenever a user intends to add, edit, or simply view an address book entity. Also it includes a dedicated field for textual notes. Additionally, when a DID is inputted, the associated account keys are automatically retrieved presented to the user.

#### Name tag funcionality

The name tag will be displayed alongside the user's DID on all portal screens. Additionally, when performing transfers and other actions, users can select a recipient by the name tag, while the associated DID is automatically fetched in the background. Displaying the user tag instead of keys associated with the DID can also be done if it heplful.

## Future Plans

In the future the account key functionality in the address book can be improve:
- dedicated tab for address book entities tagged by key (instead DID)
- displaying seconday keys that are related to the DID in form of `leon.secondary`

*Note:The suggestions can be included in the proposal as the second milestone.*

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** personal recommendation.

I gained familiarity with the codebase through the execution of a time-bound PoC. This exercise was pivotal in assessing the proposal's feasibility and in comprehending the full extent of the work required
